:warning: Please, don't take this plugin too seriously. You can make it like competitive CS:GO, but I warn you against doing so, as it was meant to be a fun plugin.

### Extra info for pepega people
This server-side plugin requires [EXILED for SCP:SL](https://github.com/galaxy119/EXILED/).

`throw_force` just means how hard the items will be thrown.

`launch_add_force` Direction (just (X.X, Y.Y, Z.Z)) that isn't actually an extra force, but the direction. Extra force just did weird (undesirable and hard to understand) things.

`initial_offset_position` Position (just (X.X, Y.Y, Z.Z)) where the item moves after spawning to appear like "you threw it from your right hand" if it was (0, 0.5, 0.5), for example.
